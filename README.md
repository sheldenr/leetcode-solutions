# Repository Description
This is basically just a repository to document my leetcode progress. I'm only just beginning to understand what I'm doing but I want to document my growth as I go on. :)

Planning to solve all problems using **Python3**.

Drawings made using Microsoft Whiteboard. Quite cool if you haven't used it before.

# Current Study Plan
Working through Neetcode Roadmap (skipping hards). Swapped from leetcode 75 on [4/5/2025] after realizing the simplicity in learning concept by concept.

# Review List
- 933 (Bad solution)
- 7 (Not happy about this one at all)
- 844 (Solution memory complexity could be improved)
- 104 (Make sure you can confidently reimplement this)
- 153 (works but learn other solutions)
- 145 (linkedlist hard)
